## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Short Message Service (SMS) spam represents a significant challenge in mobile communications, affecting user experience and network resources. Traditional rule-based filtering approaches suffer from high false positive rates and inability to adapt to evolving spam patterns. This research presents a machine learning-based solution that addresses these limitations through intelligent text analysis and adaptive classification.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Develop a high-accuracy SMS spam classification system
- Implement real-time message analysis capabilities
- Create an interpretable model with feature importance analysis
- Provide production-ready deployment components
- Enable dynamic threshold adjustment for different use cases

### 1.3 Scope

This study focuses on binary classification of English SMS messages using supervised learning techniques. The system is designed for both research applications and production deployment in telecommunications and messaging platforms.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Text Classification in SMS Domain

SMS text classification presents unique challenges compared to traditional document classification:

- **Limited Context**: Messages typically contain 160-1600 characters
- **Informal Language**: Abbreviations, misspellings, and non-standard grammar
- **Feature Sparsity**: High-dimensional feature space with limited content
- **Class Imbalance**: Spam messages typically represent 10-15% of datasets

### 2.2 Feature Engineering Approaches

**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: Simple frequency-based representation, limited semantic understanding.

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Weights terms by importance across corpus, reduces common word dominance.

**N-gram Analysis**: Captures local context through word sequences, improves pattern recognition.

### 2.3 Classification Algorithms

- **Naive Bayes**: Traditional choice for text classification, assumes feature independence
- **Support Vector Machines**: Effective for high-dimensional sparse data
- **Logistic Regression**: Interpretable linear model with probabilistic output
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks for complex pattern recognition

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Description

**Source**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset (Almeida & Hidalgo, 2011)  
**Composition**: 5,574 SMS messages  
**Format**: Tab-separated values (label, message)  
**Distribution**:
- Ham (legitimate): 4,827 messages (86.6%)
- Spam: 747 messages (13.4%)

**Quality Characteristics**:
- Real-world messages from multiple sources
- Manually labeled by domain experts
- Diverse spam categories (promotions, phishing, surveys)
- Various legitimate message types (personal, business, notifications)

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

#### 3.2.1 Text Normalization
```
Input: Raw SMS text
↓
Lowercase conversion
↓
Label standardization (ham/spam)
↓
Data validation and filtering
```

#### 3.2.2 Custom Stop Word Engineering
Standard English stop words are augmented with SMS-specific terms:

**SMS Abbreviations**: 'u', 'ur', '4', '2', 'im', 'dont', 'd'  
**Rationale**: These terms appear frequently in both ham and spam messages, providing minimal discriminative value.

#### 3.2.3 Feature Extraction Architecture

**TF-IDF Vectorization Parameters**:
- **N-gram Range**: (1,2) - unigrams and bigrams
- **Maximum Features**: 10,000 - balance between representation and efficiency
- **Lowercase**: True - normalize case variations
- **Stop Words**: English + custom SMS terms

**Mathematical Foundation**:

Term Frequency: `tf(t,d) = count(t,d) / |d|`

Inverse Document Frequency: `idf(t,D) = log(|D| / |{d ∈ D : t ∈ d}|)`

TF-IDF Score: `tfidf(t,d,D) = tf(t,d) × idf(t,D)`

### 3.3 Model Architecture

#### 3.3.1 Algorithm Selection

**Logistic Regression** was selected based on:
- Linear interpretability for feature analysis
- Probabilistic output for threshold optimization
- Computational efficiency for real-time applications
- Robust performance on sparse text data

#### 3.3.2 Model Configuration

```python
LogisticRegression(
    max_iter=1000,        # Convergence iterations
    solver='lbfgs',       # Default L-BFGS solver
    C=1.0,               # Regularization strength
    random_state=42      # Reproducibility
)
```

#### 3.3.3 Training Strategy

**Data Split**: 80% training, 20% testing (stratified)  
**Cross-Validation**: Stratified sampling maintains class distribution  
**Regularization**: L2 penalty prevents overfitting

### 3.4 Threshold Optimization

#### 3.4.1 F1-Score Maximization

The classification threshold is optimized using F1-score maximization:

`F1 = 2 × (precision × recall) / (precision + recall)`

**Algorithm**:
```
for threshold in [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, ..., 0.85]:
    predictions = (probabilities >= threshold)
    f1_score = calculate_f1(true_labels, predictions)
    if f1_score > best_f1:
        best_threshold = threshold
        best_f1 = f1_score
```

#### 3.4.2 Trade-off Analysis

**Lower Thresholds** (0.1-0.4):
- Higher recall (fewer false negatives)
- Lower precision (more false positives)
- Suitable for spam-intolerant environments

**Higher Thresholds** (0.6-0.9):
- Higher precision (fewer false positives)
- Lower recall (more false negatives)
- Suitable for user-experience focused applications
